# "Deep Fake Voice Recognition"

Welcome to a fresh start in my personal project of "Deep Fake Voice Recognition." This project has just come into existence and, as such, marks an initial step in an exciting journey towards the future of voice recognition technology.

In this corner of GitHub, I share my early strides in creating voice models based on "Deep Fake." As we progress together from the project's inception, I hope this space will become a place where we can explore and collaborate, sharing ideas and resources in the thrilling realm of the convergence between artificial intelligence and human voice.

This is a personal project that's taking shape day by day, and I'm eager to see where it will lead us in the future. I hope you find value in this newborn project and will join me on this thrilling journey into the unknown in voice recognition.

Welcome to this new adventure!
